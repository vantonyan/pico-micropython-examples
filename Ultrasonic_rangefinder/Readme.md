### Ultrasonic Rangefinder Project

This project is based on HCRS04 module that contains speaker and microphone to generate pulses and detect echo. Echo delay profides a way to measure the distance to the obsticle. The Module used for this project is available from Amazon (https://amzn.to/3fGxAcG)
https://amzn.to/3fGxAcG Module connections to Raspberry Pie Pico board:

- VCC --> Pico pin 40 (VBUS)
- GND --> Pico pin 38 (GND)
- TRIGGER --> Pico pin 2 (GP1)
- ECHO --> Pico pin 1 (GP0)

The distance is measured in mm.
