### MicroPython Practical Examples Using Raspberry Pie Pico board

Those are examples of implementation using various sensor modules

**Load_Cell**: Using HX711 sensor and load cell to create calibrated 1Kg weight scale with 0.1% precision

**Power_meter**: Utilize INA219 sensor module to measure current, voltage and power

**Servo** : Example controller for hobby servo motors using Raspberry Pie Pico board

**Tachometer**: Test code for tachometer based on hall effect sensor and magnet. Measures up to 3000 RPM

**VCP_demo**: Example code showing use of threads and how to build stand alone applications 

**Accelerometer**: Using MPU-6050 GY-521 module to create accelerometer and tilt sensor
